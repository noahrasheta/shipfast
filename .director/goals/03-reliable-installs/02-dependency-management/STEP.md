# Step 2: Dependency management

## What This Delivers

Python dependencies are pinned to known-good versions so fresh installs don't break when upstream packages release new versions. The setup script uses the lockfile, and the whole thing works from scratch on a clean machine.

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Update setup script to install from lockfile
- [ ] Task 2: Verify full install on a clean machine

## Needs First

Needs the dependency lockfile generated in Goal 1 Step 1 (pin Python dependency versions).
