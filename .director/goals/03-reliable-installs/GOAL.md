# Goal 3: Anyone can install and run plugins reliably on a clean machine

## What Success Looks Like

A new user can discover a plugin, read clear documentation about what it does and what it needs, install it with a single command, and have it work on the first run. Dependencies are pinned so installs don't break over time, and CI catches problems before they reach users.

## Steps

1. **Step 1: Plugin documentation and metadata** -- READMEs with prerequisites, install commands, and usage for both plugins
2. **Step 2: Dependency management** -- Pinned dependencies and a setup script that works from scratch
3. **Step 3: CI validation** -- GitHub Actions workflow that validates plugins and runs tests on every push

## Status

**Progress:** Not started
**Steps complete:** 0 of 3
