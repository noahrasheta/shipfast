# Task: Write README for dc-due-diligence

## What To Do

Create a README.md for the dc-due-diligence plugin that covers: what the plugin does, who it's for, prerequisites (Python 3.11+, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for image processing), installation command, usage instructions (the /due-diligence command with folder path), what to expect in the output, and the agent pipeline architecture at a high level.

## Why It Matters

Without a README, users who discover the plugin in the marketplace have no way to understand what it does, whether it fits their needs, or how to get started. The README is also rendered on the future landing page, making it the plugin's primary marketing material.

## Size

**Estimate:** medium

Requires understanding the full plugin pipeline to write accurate documentation. Needs sections for prerequisites, installation, usage, output description, and architecture overview.

## Done When

- [ ] README.md exists in the dc-due-diligence/ directory
- [ ] Includes clear prerequisites section (Python, API keys, supported file types)
- [ ] Includes single-command installation instructions
- [ ] Includes usage example with the /due-diligence command
- [ ] Describes what the output looks like (scored summary, domain reports)

## Needs First

Nothing -- this can start right away.
