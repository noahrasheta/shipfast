# Task: Write README for create-image

## What To Do

Create a README.md for the create-image plugin that covers: what the plugin does, the PaperBanana multi-agent approach, prerequisites (Gemini API key), installation command, usage instructions (the /create-image command with description), and what to expect in the output (5 image variants with critique).

## Why It Matters

Same as the dc-due-diligence README -- users need documentation to understand and trust the plugin before installing it. The create-image plugin is simpler, so this README will be shorter.

## Size

**Estimate:** small

Simpler plugin with fewer prerequisites and a more straightforward pipeline. Mostly writing clear descriptions of what exists.

## Done When

- [ ] README.md exists in the create-image/ directory
- [ ] Includes prerequisites section (Gemini API key)
- [ ] Includes installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Briefly describes the 4-agent PaperBanana pipeline

## Needs First

Nothing -- this can start right away.
