# Step 1: Plugin documentation and metadata

## What This Delivers

Both plugins have clear README files that tell a new user what the plugin does, what it needs, how to install it, and how to use it. Skill frontmatter includes argument hints for autocomplete, and plugin manifests have homepage and repository fields for discoverability.

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Write README for dc-due-diligence
- [ ] Task 2: Write README for create-image
- [ ] Task 3: Add argument-hint and metadata fields to skills and manifests

## Needs First

Nothing -- this step can start right away.
