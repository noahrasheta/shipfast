# Goal 4: shipfast.cc is a public library for discovering and installing plugins

## What Success Looks Like

Visit shipfast.cc and see every available plugin with descriptions, install commands, and detailed pages. The site reads from the existing marketplace catalog at build time, so adding a new plugin automatically shows up on the next deploy.

## Steps

1. **Step 1: Site foundation** -- Astro 5 project with Tailwind CSS 4, deployed to Cloudflare Pages
2. **Step 2: Plugin catalog** -- Homepage with plugin grid and individual plugin detail pages

## Status

**Progress:** Not started
**Steps complete:** 0 of 2
