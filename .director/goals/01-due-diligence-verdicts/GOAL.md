# Goal 1: The due diligence plugin produces nuanced, calibrated verdicts with actionable questions

## What Success Looks Like

Run the due diligence plugin on a current opportunity and get a verdict that reflects reality -- not a blanket "pass." Tier 1 domains (Power, Land/Zoning, Connectivity) carry the most weight and can sink a deal on their own. The executive summary includes a Key Questions section that tells Data Canopy exactly what needs answering before moving forward. Agents no longer flag missing design documents as a finding.

## Steps

1. **Step 1: Fix bugs and suppress noise** -- Clean up known converter bugs and stop agents from flagging expected missing documents
2. **Step 2: Calibrate scoring with tiered weighting** -- Tier 1 domains drive the verdict through qualitative reasoning
3. **Step 3: Add Key Questions section** -- Domain agents surface gaps, executive summary aggregates them

## Status

**Progress:** Not started
**Steps complete:** 0 of 3
