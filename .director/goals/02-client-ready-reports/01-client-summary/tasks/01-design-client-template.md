# Task: Design client summary template

## What To Do

Create a template for the client-facing summary document. This is a shorter, less technical version of the executive summary, designed for the person who presented the opportunity to Data Canopy. It should include: a brief overview of the analysis, key findings organized by importance (using the tier framework), the overall recommendation, and the questions Data Canopy needs answered.

## Why It Matters

The template defines the structure and tone of the client deliverable. Getting it right means deal presenters receive a professional, actionable document without seeing Data Canopy's internal scoring details.

## Size

**Estimate:** small

Template design based on the existing executive summary template, simplified and reframed for an external audience.

## Done When

- [ ] Template file created in the templates directory
- [ ] Includes sections for overview, key findings, recommendation, and questions
- [ ] Tone is professional and external-facing (no internal scoring jargon)
- [ ] Template uses markdown format matching the existing template conventions

## Needs First

Needs the due diligence pipeline updates from Goal 1 -- tiered scoring and Key Questions -- since the client summary draws from those results.
