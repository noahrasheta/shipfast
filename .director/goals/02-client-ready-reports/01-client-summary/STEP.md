# Step 1: Client-facing summary document

## What This Delivers

A standalone document summarizing the due diligence findings in a format appropriate for the deal presenter -- the person who brought the opportunity to Data Canopy. It includes key findings, the weighted ranking, and the questions Data Canopy needs answered, without exposing internal scoring details.

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design client summary template
- [ ] Task 2: Build client summary agent
- [ ] Task 3: Wire client summary into orchestrator as new wave

## Needs First

Needs the due diligence pipeline updates from Goal 1 -- tiered scoring and Key Questions -- since the client summary draws from those results.

## Decisions

### Locked
- Client summary is a separate document from the executive summary -- exec stays internal, client summary is the external deliverable
- Includes findings, weighted rankings, and key questions
