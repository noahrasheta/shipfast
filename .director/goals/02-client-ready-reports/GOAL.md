# Goal 2: Analysis results can be shared directly with deal presenters

## What Success Looks Like

After running the due diligence pipeline, two documents are ready to share: the executive summary (for Data Canopy's internal use) and a separate client-facing summary (for whoever presented the opportunity). Both are available as polished PDFs and as markdown for AI workflows.

## Steps

1. **Step 1: Client-facing summary document** -- A standalone summary with findings, rankings, and key questions for the deal presenter
2. **Step 2: PDF generation** -- Markdown-to-PDF conversion for both the executive and client summaries

## Status

**Progress:** Not started
**Steps complete:** 0 of 2
