# Gameplan

## Overview

Shipfast is a Claude Code plugin marketplace where Noah builds and distributes plugins that solve real problems. The immediate priority is making the due diligence plugin produce nuanced, client-ready results, then hardening distribution reliability and launching a public landing page.

## Goals

1. **Goal 1: The due diligence plugin produces nuanced, calibrated verdicts with actionable questions** -- Tier 1 domains drive the verdict, scoring stops defaulting to "pass," and a Key Questions section highlights gaps
2. **Goal 2: Analysis results can be shared directly with deal presenters** -- Client-facing summary and PDF output for both documents
3. **Goal 3: Anyone can install and run plugins reliably on a clean machine** -- READMEs, pinned dependencies, versioning, CI validation
4. **Goal 4: shipfast.cc is a public library for discovering and installing plugins** -- Astro landing page on Cloudflare Pages

## Current Focus

**Current Goal:** Goal 2
**Current Step:** Step 1
**Next Up:** First task in Goal 2
