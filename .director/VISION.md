# Vision

## Project Name
Shipfast

## What It Does
A personal Claude Code plugin marketplace where Noah Rasheta builds, hosts, and distributes plugins, skills, agents, and hooks. Each plugin solves a real problem across diverse domains -- from data center investment analysis to AI image generation. The marketplace makes plugins installable with a single command, and a future landing page at shipfast.cc will serve as a public library for discovery.

## Who It's For
- **Noah** -- as the plugin author and power user
- **Data Canopy team** (Andrew, Josh, Ryan) -- primary users of the due diligence plugin
- **Deal presenters** -- recipients of client-facing summary reports generated by the due diligence plugin
- **Other Claude Code users** -- anyone who discovers and installs plugins from the marketplace
- **Eventually** -- users on other AI coding platforms (Cursor, OpenCode, Codex) as cross-platform support matures

## Key Features

### Existing
- Two published plugins: `create-image` (AI image generation via 4-agent PaperBanana pipeline) and `dc-due-diligence` (data center analysis via 12-agent three-wave pipeline)
- Marketplace catalog at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with single-command install
- Python document conversion pipeline (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, scanned images)
- Scored executive summary with Pursue / Proceed with Caution / Pass verdict
- Local plugin development and testing workflow

### Adding
- **Tiered domain weighting** for due diligence scoring -- Tier 1 (Power, Land/Zoning, Connectivity), Tier 2 (Environmental, Commercials, Ownership), Tier 3 (Water/Cooling, Natural Gas, Market Comparables)
- **Key Questions section** in the executive summary -- gaps and clarification questions Data Canopy needs answered before moving forward
- **Client-facing summary** -- a separate, shorter document summarizing findings, weighted rankings, and questions, ready to send back to whoever presented the opportunity
- **PDF output** for both the executive summary and client-facing summary (markdown versions remain for AI workflows)
- Per-plugin READMEs, dependency lockfiles, consistent versioning, CI validation
- Landing page at shipfast.cc (Astro + Cloudflare Pages) as a public plugin library
- Cross-platform compatibility via Agent Skills spec (when platforms stabilize)

### Changing
- **Scoring calibration** -- current scoring is too strict (every deal gets "pass"). Tier 1 domains carry the most weight and can sink a deal alone; Tier 3 domains provide context but don't drive pass/fail
- **Suppress design commentary** -- agents should stop flagging absence of data center design documents (that's expected)
- **Fix converter bugs** -- close unclosed image file handle in vision converter, pin loose dependency versions

### Removing
- Nothing

## Tech Stack
- **Claude Code Plugin System** (1.0.33+) -- core platform for all plugins
- **Python 3.11+** -- document conversion, PDF generation, API integrations
- **Markdown + YAML frontmatter** -- agent and skill definitions
- **Anthropic Vision API** -- scanned document OCR
- **Gemini API** -- image generation
- **Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Cloudflare Pages** -- future landing page
- **pytest** -- converter test suite
- **GitHub Actions** -- future CI validation

## Success Looks Like
Re-run the due diligence plugin on a current opportunity and get: a nuanced verdict (not just "pass"), an executive summary with a useful Key Questions section, and a client-ready PDF document that can be forwarded directly to the deal presenter.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Three-tier domain weighting (Critical / Important / Context) | Andrew confirmed some domains matter far more than others -- power and zoning can kill a deal, water availability can't |
| Key Questions added to exec summary, Client Summary as separate doc | Exec summary stays focused on Data Canopy's internal evaluation; client summary is a standalone deliverable |
| PDF + Markdown dual output | Executives want PDF; Noah wants markdown for AI reuse |
| Suppress design commentary in agents | Absence of design docs is expected -- not a finding worth flagging |
| Conceptual design agent deferred | Interesting idea from Andrew but not priority for this round |
| Astro + Cloudflare Pages for landing page | Static, zero-cost, reads from existing marketplace.json at build time |
| Cross-platform expansion deferred | Cursor adapter is feasible, OpenCode spec isn't stable yet |

## Open Questions
- [UNCLEAR] Exact numerical weights for each tier -- need to determine specific scoring multipliers or thresholds (Andrew mentioned power confidence above 60-75 as a threshold for continued interest)
- [UNCLEAR] PDF generation approach -- which Python library to use (WeasyPrint, reportlab, or markdown-to-PDF pipeline)
- [UNCLEAR] Whether Andrew will send additional notes with specific feedback on the latest Arlington analysis
