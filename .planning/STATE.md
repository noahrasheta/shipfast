# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** A non-technical co-worker can run a full 9-domain data center due diligence analysis from Claude Desktop without ever touching a terminal, and get results in an editable document format.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation and Validation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Separate plugin, not fork of existing CLI plugin — CLI version stays as-is
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Architecture approach (MCP vs Project vs hybrid) — PENDING, resolved in Phase 1 empirical test
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Cowork Task tool availability — UNRESOLVED, must validate empirically in Phase 1 smoke test

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1 dependency]: Whether parallel sub-agent dispatch (Task tool) works in Cowork is the single load-bearing unknown. Phase 3 Wave 1 architecture depends on the Phase 1 smoke test result. Do not skip the parallel dispatch validation in Plan 01-03.
- [Phase 4 dependency]: Word/PDF output mechanism (native Cowork file creation vs. VM LibreOffice) depends on Phase 1 VM architecture finding. Decision point at Plan 04-03.
