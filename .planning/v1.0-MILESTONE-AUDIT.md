## Critical Integration Findings

### 1. ZIP Is Stale — Contains Only Phase 1 Content

**Severity:** Critical
**Affected:** INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04 + all downstream requirements

The distributable ZIP (`dc-due-diligence-desktop.zip`) was last built during Phase 1 Plan 02 (2026-02-23). It contains only the Phase 1 scaffold:
- 3 files totaling ~11KB
- Empty `agents/` directory
- Phase 1 stub `commands/due-diligence.md` (6,894 bytes vs current ~25KB)
- Phase 1 stub `SKILL.md` (4,099 bytes vs current ~8KB)
- No README.md

A user installing this ZIP gets file discovery only — no domain agents, no synthesis, no DOCX output, no ingestion categorization.

**Fix:** Rebuild ZIP from current repo:
```bash
cd /Users/noahrasheta/Dev/GitHub/shipfast
zip -r dc-due-diligence-desktop.zip dc-due-diligence-desktop/ --exclude "*.DS_Store"
```

### 2. Phase 4 Has No VERIFICATION.md

**Severity:** Critical
**Affected:** SYNTH-01 through SYNTH-05, OUTPUT-01 through OUTPUT-04

Phase 4 was executed (3 plans completed, commits present) but was never independently verified. This puts 9 requirements in an unverifiable state. The integration checker confirmed that cross-phase wiring is correct (synthesis chain, DOCX paths, missing-report handling), but no gsd-verifier ever ran on Phase 4.

**Fix:** Run Phase 4 verification:
```
/gsd:execute-phase 04 --verify-only
```
Or create 04-VERIFICATION.md manually by examining the Phase 4 artifacts.

### 3. Batch Splitting Not Consumed by Agents

**Severity:** Medium
**Affected:** INGEST-04

The orchestrator writes `domains.{domain}.batches[N].files[]` to `_dd_inventory.json` but all 9 domain agents read the flat `domains.{domain}.files[]` array. For domains with >20 files, batch splitting is declared but not enforced through the agent interface.

## REQUIREMENTS.md Discrepancies

| REQ-ID | REQUIREMENTS.md Says | Actual Status | Action Needed |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| PLAT-01 | [x] Complete | NOT SATISFIED (per 01-VERIFICATION) | Uncheck — change to [ ] |
| SYNTH-01..05 | [ ] Pending | Plans executed, agents exist | Run Phase 4 verification, then check |
| OUTPUT-01..04 | [ ] Pending | Plans executed, code exists | Run Phase 4 verification, then check |
| OUTPUT-03 | [ ] Pending | Deferred by user | Mark as deferred or remove |

---

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 3 items: premature PLAT-01 completion claim, SKILL.md premature "confirmed" claim, REQUIREMENTS.md inaccurate checkboxes | Medium |
| Phase 4 | 4 items: no VERIFICATION.md, non-standard SUMMARY format, stale REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes, OUTPUT-03 not formally removed | High |
| Phase 5 | 2 items: stale ROADMAP progress table, empty SUMMARY requirements-completed fields | Low |
| Cross-phase | 4 items: macOS-specific stat, premature synthesis checkpoint, Phase 1 VERIFICATION frontmatter discrepancy, stale ZIP | Medium |
| **Total** | **13 items across 4 categories** | |

---

## Orphaned Requirements Check

No orphaned requirements detected. All 33 v1 requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table are assigned to phases and claimed by at least one plan. All assigned phases have plan directories with SUMMARY files confirming execution.

## E2E User Flow Assessment

| Flow | Status | Break Point |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Plugin install (ZIP → Cowork → activate) | BROKEN | ZIP is stale (Phase 1 only) |
| Trigger analysis (/due-diligence → file discovery) | WIRED | Command file and SKILL.md aligned |
| Document ingestion (discovery → inventory → categorization → routing) | WIRED | _dd_inventory.json schema consistent |
| Domain analysis (routing → 9 agents → 9 reports) | WIRED | All agent files exist, paths match |
| Synthesis chain (reports → risk → exec summary → client summary) | WIRED | Sequential dependency correct |
| DOCX output (markdown → pandoc → .docx) | WIRED | Source and output paths aligned |
