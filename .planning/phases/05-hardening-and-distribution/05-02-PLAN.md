<objective>
Write a plain-language README that enables a non-technical user to install the plugin, run an analysis, and understand the output — without any external help.

Purpose: INFRA-04 requires clear setup instructions a non-technical user can follow. The README is the single document that determines whether a non-developer can use this plugin independently. It must be written for someone who can use Microsoft Word and double-click files, but has never opened a terminal.

Output: `dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md` — a self-contained install and usage guide.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write non-technical README for plugin installation and usage</name>
  <files>dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create `dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md` with the following sections in this exact order. The README must be written for a reader who knows what a data center is but has never used a terminal, never heard of Git, and may not know what a "plugin" is beyond "something you add to make software do more things."

**Section 1: Title and what this does**
- Title: "Data Center Due Diligence Plugin"
- 2-3 plain sentences: This plugin analyzes broker documents for a data center opportunity and produces a scored report with a Pursue / Proceed with Caution / Pass recommendation. It examines 9 areas (power, connectivity, cooling, land, ownership, environmental, commercials, natural gas, market comparables) and generates Word documents you can edit and share.

**Section 2: What you need before starting**
- Claude Desktop app (Mac) with a paid plan that includes Cowork
- A folder on your computer containing the broker documents (PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, presentations, images)
- The plugin file (a compressed folder ending in `.zip`)

Do NOT mention: API keys, Python, terminal, environment variables, pandoc. The Word output depends on pandoc but the README should not burden the user with this — markdown reports are always available.

**Section 3: How to install**
Numbered steps with concrete UI actions. Use descriptive language for UI elements rather than exact button label quotes (since Cowork UI labels may change):
1. Save the plugin `.zip` file somewhere you can find it (Downloads folder is fine)
2. Open the Claude app on your Mac
3. Switch to Cowork mode (look for "Cowork" at the top of the window)
4. Look for a way to add or upload a plugin — typically a "+" or add button in the sidebar, then choose "Plugins"
5. Drag the `.zip` file into the window that appears, then confirm the upload
6. The plugin will install in a few seconds — you should see "Due Diligence" appear in your available tools

**Section 4: How to use it**
1. In Cowork, connect your documents folder: look for an option like "Work in a folder" and choose the folder containing your broker documents
2. Type `/due-diligence` and press Enter
3. The plugin will scan your documents, sort them by topic, and dispatch specialized analysts for each area
4. For a typical data room (20-50 files), expect the analysis to take 20-40 minutes — progress updates will appear as each area completes
5. When finished, you will see a verdict (Pursue / Proceed with Caution / Pass) along with key highlights

**Section 5: What the output looks like**
Describe the deliverables in plain language:
- An executive summary with scores for each area and an overall recommendation
- A client-facing summary suitable for sharing with deal stakeholders (no internal scoring language)
- A risk assessment identifying issues that span multiple areas
- 9 detailed domain reports (one per area analyzed)
- If Word document generation is available, `.docx` files will appear in an `output` folder inside your documents folder
- Markdown versions of all reports are always available in the documents folder

**Section 6: If something goes wrong (Troubleshooting)**
3-5 specific problems with plain-language answers:

1. "The analysis stopped partway through" — This can happen if your internet connection drops or the app is interrupted. Just type `/due-diligence` again. The plugin remembers what it already finished and will pick up where it left off, skipping any completed work.

2. "Some areas are missing from the report" — If certain topic areas show as "MISSING" after the analysis, it usually means the documents didn't contain enough information for that area, or the analyst for that area ran into a problem. The final report will note which areas couldn't be evaluated. You can re-run `/due-diligence` to retry just the missing areas.

3. "I don't see the /due-diligence command" — Make sure you uploaded the plugin file successfully. Look in your plugin list for "Due Diligence." If it's not there, try uploading the `.zip` file again.

4. "I don't see any Word documents" — Word document generation requires an additional tool (pandoc) that may not be set up on your computer. The analysis results are still available as text files in your documents folder — you can open them with any text editor or copy the content into Word manually.

5. "The analysis is taking a very long time" — Large document collections (50+ files) can take 30-45 minutes. The plugin processes all 9 areas simultaneously, but each area needs time to read documents and research current market data online.

**Anti-patterns to avoid (DO NOT include any of these in the README):**
- Terminal commands, shell prompts, `$` prefixes
- "clone the repo", "git clone", "git", "GitHub"
- "terminal", "bash", "path", "CLI", "API", "token", "context window", "environment variable"
- "run this command", "install", "configure" (use "set up" or "add" instead)
- Links to GitHub for installation
- Assuming the user knows what a ZIP file is beyond "compressed folder"
- Technical implementation details (agent architecture, JSON files, checkpoint system)

1. `dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md` exists and is >= 80 lines
2. `grep -ciE '(terminal|bash|CLI|git clone|api key|token|context window|environment variable)' dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md` returns 0
3. `grep -c 'Step [0-9]' dc-due-diligence-desktop/README.md` returns >= 4 (numbered install/usage steps)
4. README contains sections for: what it does, prerequisites, install, usage, output, troubleshooting

<success_criteria>
- A non-technical user reading only the README can install the plugin and complete a full analysis run
- README contains zero terminal commands, git references, or technical jargon
- README is self-contained — every question a confused user might have is answered in the document
- README accurately describes the hardened UX (progress feedback, failure messaging, retry) from Plan 05-01
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-hardening-and-distribution/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
